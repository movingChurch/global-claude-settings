# Agent Build Command

Create specialist AI agents with defined expertise, personality, and boundaries through systematic analysis and template-based generation.

## Usage

```bash
/agent build [agent-name]
```

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Agent role and core identity
   - Specific expertise and technical knowledge domains
   - Personality traits and interaction style
   - Boundaries and responsibilities (what agent does/doesn't do)
   - Collaboration patterns with other agents
   - Output formats and communication preferences
   - Tools and resources the agent should have access to

2. **Agent Analysis** - Analyze gathered requirements to define:
   - Clear role definition and scope
   - Specific technical expertise areas
   - Consistent personality and interaction patterns
   - Well-defined boundaries and limitations

3. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create agent document using template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/agent-prompt-template.md`

4. **File Creation** - Save document to `~/.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`

## Output

```
Created: ~/.claude/agents/[agent-name].md

ðŸ¤– AGENT CREATED:
âœ“ Agent role and identity clearly defined
âœ“ Specific expertise domains documented
âœ“ Personality traits and interaction style established
âœ“ Boundaries and responsibilities specified
âœ“ Collaboration patterns with other agents defined
âœ“ Communication preferences and output formats set
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Well-defined specialist agent with clear expertise, consistent personality, and unambiguous boundaries that integrates effectively with the system
**BAD** = Generic agent, unclear expertise scope, or conflicting boundaries that create confusion in multi-agent interactions
