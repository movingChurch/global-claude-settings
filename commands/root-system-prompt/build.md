# Root System Prompt Build Command

Create universal LLM behavior rules that apply across all projects through systematic analysis and template-based generation.

## Usage

```bash
/root-system-prompt build
```

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Core LLM roles and responsibilities
   - Universal behavior principles and guidelines
   - Common output formats and communication standards
   - Global restrictions and boundaries
   - Document structure recognition requirements
   - Error handling and reporting standards
   - Quality assurance and verification protocols

2. **Rule Analysis** - Analyze gathered requirements to define:
   - Operator and agent role definitions
   - Universal principles that apply to all projects
   - Standard communication patterns
   - Common document structure expectations

3. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create system prompt using template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/root-system-prompt.md`

4. **File Creation** - Save document to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Output

```
Created: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

ðŸ§  ROOT SYSTEM PROMPT CREATED:
âœ“ Universal LLM roles and responsibilities defined
âœ“ Core behavior principles and guidelines established
âœ“ Standard communication patterns and formats specified
âœ“ Global restrictions and quality standards documented
âœ“ Document structure recognition requirements included
âœ“ Error handling and verification protocols defined
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Complete universal behavior rules that provide consistent foundation for all LLM operations across any project type with clear principles and standards
**BAD** = Project-specific rules, unclear principles, or missing critical behavior guidelines that lead to inconsistent LLM performance across projects
