# Architecture Build Command

Design comprehensive project-specific structure and architectural decisions through systematic analysis and template-based documentation.

## Usage

```bash
/architecture build [project-name]
```

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Project purpose and scope
   - Technical requirements and constraints
   - Folder structure and module organization
   - Data flow and system interactions
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Scalability and performance needs
   - Security and compliance requirements

2. **Architecture Analysis** - Analyze gathered requirements to define:
   - Project-specific folder hierarchy
   - Module responsibilities and boundaries
   - Design patterns and architectural decisions
   - Variable definitions and configuration structure

3. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create architecture document using template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/architecture-template.md`

4. **File Creation** - Save document to `./documents/architectures/[project-name].md`

## Output

```
Created: ./documents/architectures/[project-name].md

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE CREATED:
‚úì Project structure and folder hierarchy defined
‚úì Module responsibilities and boundaries established
‚úì Data flow and system interactions documented
‚úì Design patterns and architectural decisions specified
‚úì Variable definitions and configuration structure included
‚úì Integration points and dependencies mapped
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Complete project-specific architecture with clear structure, well-defined responsibilities, and consistent patterns that guide implementation decisions
**BAD** = Generic or incomplete structure, unclear module boundaries, or missing critical architectural decisions that lead to inconsistent implementation
