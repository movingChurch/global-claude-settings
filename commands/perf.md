Use the performance-optimizer agent to analyze performance.

Analysis:

1. **Performance Profiling**
   - Execution time measurement
   - Memory usage profiling
   - CPU utilization
   - I/O operations

2. **Bottleneck Detection**
   - Hot path identification
   - Algorithm complexity analysis
   - Database query optimization
   - Network latency issues

3. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Algorithm improvements
   - Caching strategies
   - Lazy loading
   - Parallel processing

4. **Real-time Constraints**
   - Response time validation
   - Throughput measurement
   - Latency analysis
   - Resource limits

Generate performance report with specific optimization recommendations.
