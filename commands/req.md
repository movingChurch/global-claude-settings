Use the requirement-analyzer agent to analyze requirements: $ARGUMENTS

Process:

1. **Parse Requirements**
   - Extract functional requirements
   - Identify non-functional requirements
   - Detect ambiguities

2. **Create Tasks**
   - Break down into atomic DDRIVE tasks
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Estimate story points
   - Identify dependencies

3. **Validate Completeness**
   - Ensure testability
   - Confirm measurable outcomes
   - Check technical feasibility

4. **Generate Output**
   - Structured task definitions
   - Test scenarios
   - Success metrics

Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.
Create tasks that follow our TDD and Readable Code methodology.
