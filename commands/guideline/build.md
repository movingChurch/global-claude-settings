# Guideline Build Command

Create comprehensive coding standards and best practices documentation for specific technologies through systematic questioning and template-based generation.

## Usage

```bash
/guideline build [tech-stack]
```

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Technology/framework specifics
   - Coding conventions and naming standards
   - Project structure preferences
   - Quality and testing standards
   - Security and performance considerations
   - Tool and library preferences

2. **Requirement Validation** - Ensure all guidelines are clear, actionable, and complete

3. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create guideline document using template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/guideline-template.md`

4. **File Creation** - Save document to `../documents/guidelines/[tech-stack].md`

## Output

```
Created: ../documents/guidelines/[tech-stack].md

ðŸ“‹ GUIDELINE CREATED:
âœ“ Comprehensive coding standards defined
âœ“ Naming conventions and formatting rules established
âœ“ Best practices and patterns documented
âœ“ Quality standards and testing requirements specified
âœ“ Security and performance guidelines included
âœ“ Tool and library recommendations provided
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Complete, actionable coding standards that can be consistently applied across projects with clear examples and rationale
**BAD** = Vague guidelines, missing critical standards, or inconsistent formatting that leads to ambiguous implementation
