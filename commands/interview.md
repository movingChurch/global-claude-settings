# Interview Command

Conducts systematic requirement gathering through persistent, detailed questioning to extract all necessary context.

## Context Clarification

This command IS the context clarification tool. Use it whenever:

1. **Requirements are vague or incomplete**
2. **Multiple interpretations are possible**
3. **Critical details are missing**
4. **Assumptions need validation**

Continue questioning until 100% clarity is achieved.

## Usage

```bash
/interview [topic or requirement]
```

## What It Does

1. **Interactive Korean Questioning** - Ask one focused question at a time in Korean, building on previous responses
2. **Response Analysis** - Analyze each user response to identify gaps, ambiguities, and follow-up needs
3. **Adaptive Questioning** - Refine and improve questions based on received answers and discovered context
4. **Assumption Challenge** - Question everything that seems obvious and validate assumptions through Korean dialogue
5. **Context Building** - Continue iterative questioning until sufficient context is established
6. **Gap Identification** - Identify missing information and edge cases through progressive inquiry
7. **Completion Validation** - Ensure all requirements are clear before concluding interview

## Output

```text
Interactive Korean conversation with iterative questioning:
- One focused question at a time in Korean
- Response analysis and follow-up question generation
- Technical requirement clarifications through dialogue
- Edge case identification through progressive inquiry
- Assumption validation via Korean Q&A
- Missing context discovery through adaptive questioning
- Complete requirement specification through iterative process
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = All requirements fully understood through Korean dialogue, no ambiguities remain, complete context captured through iterative questioning
**BAD** = Vague understanding, assumptions left unchallenged, missing critical information, or rushed questioning without sufficient iteration
