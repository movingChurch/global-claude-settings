# Complete Development Workflow Command (Natural Language Support)

A command that manages the entire feature development process through natural conversation. It coordinates the entire process from design to implementation, monitors progress, and ensures compliance with quality guidelines.

## Usage

```bash
/workflow [describe in natural language]
```

**Natural Language Input Examples:**

**Starting New Features:**
- "I want to create user login functionality from scratch"
- "I want to develop a payment system comprehensively"
- "Please create an online shopping mall"

**Progress Status Check:**
- "I'm curious about the user authentication project progress"
- "How far has payment functionality development progressed?"
- "Please show me the overall project status"

**Process Management:**
- "Can we move to the next stage?"
- "Please conduct quality inspection"
- "Are there any risk factors?"

**Interactive Process Management:**
The workflow coordinator guides the entire process through natural conversation.

## What This Command Does

1. **Complete lifecycle management**: Orchestrates Design â†’ Tasks â†’ Implementation
2. **Phase transition control**: Validates quality gates between phases
3. **Git workflow integration**: Manages branch strategies and PR processes
4. **Quality gate enforcement**: Ensures standards compliance at each phase
5. **Risk monitoring**: Proactive identification and mitigation
6. **Stakeholder coordination**: Manages communication and reviews

## Context Provided

The command automatically includes:

- **Project Guidelines**: All content from `/documents/guidelines/` (mandatory)
- **Architecture Context**: System design and technical decisions
- **Design Standards**: Project design conventions and patterns
- **Workflow Policies**: Feature development standards and procedures

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start complete feature development
/workflow I want to create a system where users can log in safely. I'd like to strengthen security with OAuth2 and JWT

# Check progress status
/workflow How is payment system development progressing? Are there any risk factors or problems?

# Stage transition
/workflow Dashboard UI design is finished, can we move to the task breakdown stage?

# Progress monitoring
/workflow I want to continue monitoring user authentication feature development. Please let me know if problems arise

# Start complex project
/workflow I want to create an online shopping mall. I need user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment functionality

# Situational inquiries
/workflow Please show me a list of all currently ongoing projects
/workflow What tasks need to be completed this week?
```

## Feature Lifecycle Management

### Phase Structure

**Phase 1: Design (1 week)**
- Branch: `feature/###-[feature-name]-design`
- Entry: Requirements defined, stakeholders identified
- Exit: Design documents complete, ADRs recorded, PR merged
- Deliverables: `/documents/features/###-[feature-name]/design/`

**Phase 2: Task Documentation (3 days)**  
- Branch: `feature/###-[feature-name]-tasks`
- Entry: Design complete and approved
- Exit: All tasks documented, plan approved, PR merged
- Deliverables: `/documents/features/###-[feature-name]/tasks/`

**Phase 3: Implementation (1-3 weeks)**
- Branch: `feature/###-[feature-name]`
- Entry: Task documentation complete, resources allocated
- Exit: Code implemented, tests passing >80%, reviews approved, PR merged
- Deliverables: Working software, test suites, documentation

### Quality Gate Management

**Design Approval Gate**
- âœ… All requirements addressed
- âœ… Architecture review passed
- âœ… Security review completed
- âœ… Performance considerations documented
- **Reviewers**: Technical Lead, Security Architect, Product Owner

**Task Validation Gate**
- âœ… All tasks have acceptance criteria
- âœ… Dependencies correctly identified  
- âœ… Resource estimates validated
- âœ… Implementation approach confirmed
- **Reviewers**: Development Team Lead, Technical Architect

**Implementation Acceptance Gate**
- âœ… Functionality matches design
- âœ… All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- âœ… Security scan passed
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met
- âœ… Documentation complete
- **Reviewers**: Code Reviewers, QA Team, Product Owner

## What Happens Next

The workflow-coordinator agent will:

1. **Initialize feature structure** with proper documentation hierarchy
2. **Set up Git workflows** with appropriate branch strategies
3. **Coordinate phase orchestrators**:
   - `design-orchestrator`: For Phase 1 design work
   - `task-orchestrator`: For Phase 2 task breakdown  
   - `implementation-orchestrator`: For Phase 3 implementation
4. **Manage phase transitions** with quality gate validation
5. **Monitor progress and risks** proactively
6. **Coordinate reviews and approvals** at each phase
7. **Maintain stakeholder communication** throughout lifecycle

## Branch Strategy

```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/001-auth-design      # Phase 1: Design
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/001-auth-tasks       # Phase 2: Tasks  
â””â”€â”€ feature/001-auth-system      # Phase 3: Implementation
```

```

## Risk Management

The coordinator proactively monitors:

- **Schedule Adherence**: Track timeline vs. actuals
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, code quality scores  
- **Dependency Blockers**: External dependencies and handoffs
- **Technical Risks**: Architecture, security, performance concerns
- **Resource Risks**: Team availability and skill gaps

Risk levels and alerts:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**: On track, no issues identified
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**: Minor delays or quality concerns
- ðŸ”´ **High Risk**: Significant blockers or quality issues

## Document Structure Created

- **Weekly Status Reports**: Comprehensive progress summaries  
- **Phase Completion Notifications**: Milestone achievements
- **Risk Alerts**: Proactive issue identification
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Regular communication cadence

## Success Metrics

## When to Use This Command

**Use `/workflow`** for:
- âœ… New feature development requiring full lifecycle management
- âœ… Complex features with multiple stakeholders  
- âœ… Features with strict quality requirements
- âœ… Cross-team coordination needs
- âœ… Risk monitoring and mitigation

- âœ… Single-phase work
- âœ… Simple features  
- âœ… Iterative improvements
- âœ… Quick prototypes

Use this command when you need comprehensive, end-to-end feature development management with quality gates, risk monitoring, and stakeholder coordination.
