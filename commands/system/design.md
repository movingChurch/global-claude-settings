# Design Command

Create comprehensive architecture design documentation through systematic Korean questioning, research, and specialist consultation.

## Usage

```bash
/design [feature description]
```

## What It Does

1. **Korean Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Feature name for directory structure
   - Business purpose and objectives
   - Target users and use cases
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Technical constraints and limitations
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Performance and scalability needs
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Continue questioning until user confirms completion

2. **Context Loading** - Load project context:
   - Load existing requirements.md from `documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md` (if exists)
   - Load project standards from `documents/standards/`
   - Load architecture context from `documents/projects/`
   - Check `documents/standards/` for mandatory design process requirements

3. **Reference Research** - Research relevant information:
   - Use WebSearch to find industry best practices and patterns
   - Use WebFetch to analyze relevant documentation and references
   - Gather technical approaches and implementation strategies

4. **Context Preparation** - Prepare comprehensive context for specialists:
   - Requirements and objectives
   - Project standards and architectural constraints
   - Research findings and industry references
   - Technical requirements and constraints

5. **Design Generation** - Call specialist agents as needed with full context:
   - Pass all gathered context to each specialist agent
   - Ensure specialists work within established project constraints
   - Generate architecture design using multiple specialists when beneficial

6. **Document Creation** - Generate architecture document:
   - Load template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/architecture-template.md`
   - **MANDATORY**: Must use loaded template as exact base structure - NO modifications to template structure allowed
   - **MANDATORY**: All sections, headings, and formatting from template must be preserved exactly
   - **MANDATORY**: Only substitute variables (${PROJECT_NAME}, ${FEATURE_NAME}) and fill content placeholders
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Creating custom sections, changing section order, or modifying template structure
   - Create `documents/design/[feature-name]/architecture.md`
   - Include tables and mermaid diagrams as specified in template structure only

## Output

```text
Created: documents/design/[feature-name]/architecture.md

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT CREATED:
‚úì Feature requirements gathered through Korean interview
‚úì Project standards and architectural constraints loaded
‚úì Industry references and best practices researched
‚úì Comprehensive context prepared for design specialists
‚úì Architecture design generated using specialist agents
‚úì Visual diagrams and tables included for clarity
‚úì Architecture document ready for implementation planning
```

## Anti-Overengineering Rules

**NEVER DO:**
- Design beyond what requirements specify
- Add architecture components not needed for requirements
- Over-abstract or add unnecessary complexity
- Create "future-proof" designs for unspecified needs
- Add extra diagrams or sections beyond template structure

**ONLY DO WHAT'S ESSENTIAL:**
- ‚úÖ Design only for documented requirements
- ‚úÖ Use simplest solution that meets needs
- ‚úÖ Follow template structure exactly
- ‚úÖ Keep architecture at appropriate abstraction level
- ‚úÖ Focus on solving stated problems only

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Clear architecture document with comprehensive context, visual diagrams, and actionable design that aligns with project standards and requirements
**BAD** = Ambiguous architecture, missing context, over-engineered design, or architecture that conflicts with project standards and constraints
