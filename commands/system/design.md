# Design Command

Create comprehensive architecture design documentation through systematic Korean questioning, research, and specialist consultation.

## Usage

```bash
/design [feature description]
```

## What It Does

1. **Korean Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Feature name for directory structure
   - Business purpose and objectives
   - Target users and use cases
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Technical constraints and limitations
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Performance and scalability needs
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Continue questioning until user confirms completion

2. **Context Loading** - Load project context:
   - Load existing requirements.md from `documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md` (if exists)
   - Load project guidelines from `documents/guidelines/`
   - Load architecture context from `documents/architectures/`

3. **Reference Research** - Research relevant information:
   - Use WebSearch to find industry best practices and patterns
   - Use WebFetch to analyze relevant documentation and references
   - Gather technical approaches and implementation strategies

4. **Context Preparation** - Prepare comprehensive context for specialists:
   - Requirements and objectives
   - Project guidelines and architectural constraints
   - Research findings and industry references
   - Technical requirements and constraints

5. **Design Generation** - Call specialist agents as needed with full context:
   - Pass all gathered context to each specialist agent
   - Ensure specialists work within established project constraints
   - Generate architecture design using multiple specialists when beneficial

6. **Document Creation** - Generate architecture document:
   - Use `architecture-template.md` as base structure
   - Create `documents/design/[feature-name]/architecture.md`
   - Include tables and mermaid diagrams for visual clarity

## Output

```text
Created: documents/design/[feature-name]/architecture.md

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT CREATED:
‚úì Feature requirements gathered through Korean interview
‚úì Project guidelines and architectural constraints loaded
‚úì Industry references and best practices researched
‚úì Comprehensive context prepared for design specialists
‚úì Architecture design generated using specialist agents
‚úì Visual diagrams and tables included for clarity
‚úì Architecture document ready for implementation planning
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Clear architecture document with comprehensive context, visual diagrams, and actionable design that aligns with project standards and requirements
**BAD** = Ambiguous architecture, missing context, or design that conflicts with project guidelines and constraints
