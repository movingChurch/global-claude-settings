# Document Define Command

Create requirements documents through systematic questioning and template-based creation using the requirements-template.md structure.

## Usage

```bash
/document define
```

**Options:**

- No arguments - Fully interactive mode to gather feature name and all requirements

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Process Guide Loading** - Load development process requirements:
   - Check `documents/standards/` for project-specific workflow requirements
   - Load any mandatory process steps for requirements gathering

2. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements:
   - Start with feature name for directory structure
   - Gather project purpose and objectives
   - Collect expected deliverables and outcomes
   - Gather detailed functional requirements iteratively
   - Collect specific acceptance criteria and success metrics
   - Identify any constraints or dependencies
   - **Continue iterative questioning until user confirms all requirements are complete**
   - **Do not proceed to next step until user explicitly states "done" or "complete"**

3. **Structure Creation** - Create directory structure: `documents/design/[feature-name]/`

4. **Template Loading** - Load requirements template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/requirements-template.md`

5. **Requirement Processing** - Process requirements into 5W1H format:
   - Transform each functional requirement into 5W1H sentence structure
   - Ensure each requirement clearly specifies: who, what, when, where, why, and how
   - Validate requirements are clear, actionable, and complete

6. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create requirements document:
   - **MANDATORY**: Must use loaded template as exact base structure - NO modifications to template structure allowed
   - **MANDATORY**: All sections, headings, and formatting from template must be preserved exactly
   - **MANDATORY**: Only substitute variables (${PROJECT_NAME}, ${FEATURE_NAME}) and fill content placeholders
   - **FORBIDDEN**: Creating custom sections, changing section order, or modifying template structure
   - Create Korean requirements document following template structure precisely

7. **File Creation** - Save Korean requirements document to `documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md`

## Output

```text
Created: documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md

ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT CREATED:
âœ“ Feature name collected and directory structure established
âœ“ Project purpose clearly defined in one sentence (Korean)
âœ“ Expected deliverables and outcomes documented (Korean)
âœ“ Detailed requirements gathered using 5W1H methodology (Korean)
âœ“ Each requirement includes who, what, when, where, why, and how
âœ“ Acceptance criteria and success metrics specified (Korean)
âœ“ Template structure followed for consistency
âœ“ Korean requirements document ready for development planning
```

## Anti-Overengineering Rules

**NEVER DO:**
- Add requirements not explicitly requested by user
- Create additional sections beyond template structure
- Assume future needs or add "nice-to-have" features
- Over-complicate simple requirements
- Add technical implementation details (belongs in design phase)

**ONLY DO WHAT'S ESSENTIAL:**
- âœ… Document exactly what user requested
- âœ… Use template structure precisely as-is
- âœ… Transform requirements into 5W1H sentence format for clarity
- âœ… Keep requirements at appropriate abstraction level
- âœ… Focus on business needs, not technical solutions

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Clear, actionable requirements document with complete 5W1H details for each requirement that can guide development decisions
**BAD** = Ambiguous requirements, missing context, vague descriptions, or over-engineered requirements beyond user requests
