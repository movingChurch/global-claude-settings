# Document Define Command

Create requirements documents through systematic questioning and template-based creation using the requirements-template.md structure.

## Usage

```bash
/document define
```

**Options:**

- No arguments - Fully interactive mode to gather feature name and all requirements

## Context Clarification

Before building, if requirements are unclear:

1. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather all requirements
2. **Continue questioning** until all details are clear and complete
3. **Verify understanding** before document generation
4. **Never assume** - always ask when uncertain

## What It Does

1. **Process Guide Loading** - Load development process requirements:
   - Check `documents/process/` for project-specific workflow requirements
   - Load any mandatory process steps for requirements gathering

2. **Interview Process** - Use `/interview` command to systematically gather requirements about:
   - Feature name for directory structure
   - Project purpose and objectives
   - Expected deliverables and outcomes
   - Detailed functional requirements with 5W1H methodology
   - Specific acceptance criteria and success metrics
   - Any constraints or dependencies
   - Continue questioning until user confirms completion

3. **Structure Creation** - Create directory structure: `documents/design/[feature-name]/`

4. **Template Loading** - Load requirements template from `~/.claude/documents/templates/requirements-template.md`

5. **Requirement Validation** - Ensure all requirements are clear, actionable, and complete using 5W1H framework

6. **Document Generation** - Call `@technical-writer` to create requirements document in Korean following template structure with variable substitution

7. **File Creation** - Save Korean requirements document to `documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md`

## Output

```text
Created: documents/design/[feature-name]/requirements.md

ðŸ“‹ REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT CREATED:
âœ“ Feature name collected and directory structure established
âœ“ Project purpose clearly defined in one sentence (Korean)
âœ“ Expected deliverables and outcomes documented (Korean)
âœ“ Detailed requirements gathered using 5W1H methodology (Korean)
âœ“ Each requirement includes who, what, when, where, why, and how
âœ“ Acceptance criteria and success metrics specified (Korean)
âœ“ Template structure followed for consistency
âœ“ Korean requirements document ready for development planning
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = Clear, actionable requirements document with complete 5W1H details for each requirement that can guide development decisions
**BAD** = Ambiguous requirements, missing context, or vague descriptions that lead to unclear implementation goals
