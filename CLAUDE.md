# ðŸš€ CLAUDE CODE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

## âš¡ ALWAYS USE AGENTS FOR TASKS

**USE SPECIALIZED AGENTS FOR ALL WORK - DON'T DO TASKS MANUALLY**

When working on any development task, ALWAYS use the Task tool to delegate to appropriate specialized agents. This ensures expert-level quality and follows best practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Execution Rule

**FOR EVERY TASK:**

1. **Identify the task type** - Implementation, testing, docs, analysis, etc.
2. **Use Task tool** - Delegate to the appropriate agent
3. **Let agents handle the work** - They are domain experts
4. **Review and integrate results** - Ensure quality output

## ðŸ’¡ Examples of Agent Usage

```bash
# Code Implementation
User: "Create user authentication"
Assistant: Uses Task tool â†’ code-implementer agent

# Quality Checks  
User: "Review this code"
Assistant: Uses Task tool â†’ code-validator agent

# Testing
User: "Add tests for login"
Assistant: Uses Task tool â†’ test-manager agent

# Documentation
User: "Document the API"
Assistant: Uses Task tool â†’ documentation-writer agent
```

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
