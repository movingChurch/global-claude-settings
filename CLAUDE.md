# üöÄ CLAUDE CODE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

## ‚ö° ALWAYS USE AGENTS FOR TASKS

**USE SPECIALIZED AGENTS FOR ALL WORK - DON'T DO TASKS MANUALLY**

When working on any development task, ALWAYS use the Task tool to delegate to appropriate specialized agents. This ensures expert-level quality and follows best practices.

## üéØ Task Execution Rule

**FOR EVERY TASK:**

1. **Identify the task type** - Implementation, testing, docs, analysis, etc.
2. **Use Task tool** - Delegate to the appropriate agent
3. **Let agents handle the work** - They are domain experts
4. **Review and integrate results** - Ensure quality output

## üí° Examples of Agent Usage

```bash
# Code Implementation
User: "Create user authentication"
Assistant: Uses Task tool ‚Üí code-implementer agent

# Quality Checks  
User: "Review this code"
Assistant: Uses Task tool ‚Üí code-validator agent

# Testing
User: "Add tests for login"
Assistant: Uses Task tool ‚Üí test-manager agent

# Documentation
User: "Document the API"
Assistant: Uses Task tool ‚Üí documentation-writer agent
```

## üîÑ COMMAND-FIRST APPROACH: Use Pre-Built Workflows

**USE COMMANDS WHEN AVAILABLE - DON'T IMPLEMENT MANUALLY**

Commands are pre-built, tested workflows that handle common development tasks. They provide structured approaches with best practices built-in. Always check for available commands before implementing tasks manually.

### üìã When to Use Commands vs Agents

**Use Commands For:**
- Common development workflows (testing, deployment, refactoring)
- Multi-step processes with established patterns
- Tasks requiring specific tool configurations
- Project setup and initialization
- Code quality and review processes

**Use Agents For:**
- Custom implementation work
- Domain-specific expertise
- Content creation and analysis
- Specialized technical tasks
- Complex problem-solving

### ‚ö° Commands Provide Structured Workflows

Commands encapsulate entire workflows with:
- **Standardized processes** - Consistent execution every time
- **Best practices** - Proven approaches built-in
- **Error handling** - Robust failure recovery
- **Tool integration** - Proper configuration of tools
- **Quality gates** - Validation at each step

### üí° Command Usage Examples

```bash
# Instead of manually setting up tests
User: "Add tests to this component"
Assistant: Uses /test command ‚Üí Comprehensive test setup with TDD

# Instead of manual code review
User: "Review my changes"
Assistant: Uses /code-review command ‚Üí Full review workflow

# Instead of manual refactoring
User: "Modernize this codebase"
Assistant: Uses /refactor command ‚Üí Systematic refactoring process

# Instead of manual project setup
User: "Create a new React project"
Assistant: Uses /init-project command ‚Üí Complete project initialization

# Instead of manual CI setup
User: "Setup continuous integration"
Assistant: Uses /ci-setup command ‚Üí Full CI/CD pipeline configuration
```

### üìÅ Command Location and Discovery

All commands are located in `/Users/undo/.claude/commands/` and include:

- **Setup Commands** - Project initialization and configuration
- **Quality Commands** - Linting, testing, and code review
- **Git Commands** - Version control workflows
- **Architecture Commands** - Design and documentation
- **Analysis Commands** - Codebase insights and reporting

### üéØ Command-First Decision Matrix

**Always ask:** "Is there a command for this?"

1. **Check commands first** - Browse available commands
2. **Use command if available** - Execute structured workflow
3. **Use agent if no command** - Delegate to domain expert
4. **Never implement manually** - Always use tools/agents

### ‚úÖ Command Benefits

- **Consistency** - Same process every time
- **Completeness** - All steps included
- **Quality** - Best practices enforced
- **Speed** - Faster than manual implementation
- **Reliability** - Tested workflows

## üõë CRITICAL RULES

1. **COMMAND-FIRST** - Check for available commands before implementing
2. **NEVER work manually** - Always use commands or agents
3. **Choose the right tool** - Commands for workflows, agents for expertise
4. **Trust the systems** - Commands and agents are domain specialists
5. **Use multiple tools** - Combine commands and agents as needed
6. **Structured approach** - Commands ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Never manual

## ‚úÖ Remember

- **Commands first, then agents** - Use structured workflows when available
- **Every task uses tools** - Commands for workflows, agents for expertise  
- **Commands are tested workflows** - Proven processes with best practices
- **Agents are domain experts** - Deep knowledge and specialized skills
- **Quality is guaranteed** - Both systems follow professional standards
- **Never implement manually** - Always use the provided tools

## COMMANDS ‚Üí AGENTS ‚Üí NEVER MANUAL

## Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
