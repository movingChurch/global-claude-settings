## TDD Cycle Management

### Red-Green-Refactor Workflow
```yaml
red_phase:
  purpose: "Write failing test first"
  actions:
    - Generate test based on requirements
    - Ensure test fails for right reason
    - Validate test quality
  verification:
    - Test must fail
    - Failure reason must be correct
    - Test must be comprehensive

green_phase:
  purpose: "Make test pass with minimal code"
  actions:
    - Implement minimal solution
    - Run test to verify pass
    - Ensure no over-engineering
  verification:
    - Test must pass
    - Implementation must be minimal
    - No other tests broken

refactor_phase:
  purpose: "Improve code while keeping tests green"
  actions:
    - Identify improvement opportunities
    - Apply refactoring
    - Verify all tests still pass
  verification:
    - All tests must pass
    - Code quality improved
    - No behavior changes
```

## Test Generation Patterns

### Unit Test Generation
```python
def generate_unit_test(function_spec):
    """
    Generate comprehensive unit tests
    """
    test_cases = []
    
    # Happy path
    test_cases.append(generate_happy_path_test(function_spec))
    
    # Edge cases
    test_cases.extend(generate_edge_case_tests(function_spec))
    
    # Error cases
    test_cases.extend(generate_error_tests(function_spec))
    
    # Boundary conditions
    test_cases.extend(generate_boundary_tests(function_spec))
    
    return format_test_suite(test_cases)
```

### Test Structure Templates
```yaml
test_templates:
  unit_test:
    pattern: |
      def test_{function_name}_{scenario}():
          # Arrange
          {setup_code}
          
          # Act
          {action_code}
          
          # Assert
          {assertion_code}
  
  integration_test:
    pattern: |
      def test_{feature}_{interaction}():
          # Setup environment
          {environment_setup}
          
          # Execute workflow
          {workflow_steps}
          
          # Verify integration
          {integration_checks}
  
  e2e_test:
    pattern: |
      def test_{user_journey}():
          # Setup scenario
          {scenario_setup}
          
          # User actions
          {user_steps}
          
          # Verify outcome
          {outcome_verification}
```

## Test Execution Management

### Test Runner Configuration
```yaml
runners:
  python:
    command: "pytest"
    options:
      - "-v" # verbose
      - "--cov" # coverage
      - "--tb=short" # traceback format
    coverage_tool: "pytest-cov"
    
  javascript:
    command: "npm test"
    options:
      - "--coverage"
      - "--watchAll=false"
    coverage_tool: "jest"
    
  go:
    command: "go test"
    options:
      - "-v"
      - "-cover"
      - "-race"
    coverage_tool: "go cover"
```

### Execution Strategies
```yaml
execution_modes:
  single_test:
    command: "{runner} {test_file}::{test_name}"
    use_case: "Run specific test"
    
  test_suite:
    command: "{runner} {test_directory}"
    use_case: "Run all tests in directory"
    
  watch_mode:
    command: "{runner} --watch"
    use_case: "Continuous testing during development"
    
  coverage_mode:
    command: "{runner} --coverage --coverage-report=html"
    use_case: "Generate coverage report"
```

## Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Metrics
```yaml
coverage_thresholds:
  line_coverage:
    minimum: 80
    target: 90
    measurement: "lines executed / total lines"
    
  branch_coverage:
    minimum: 75
    target: 85
    measurement: "branches taken / total branches"
    
  function_coverage:
    minimum: 90
    target: 95
    measurement: "functions called / total functions"
```

### Coverage Report Generation
```python
def generate_coverage_report():
    """
    Generate comprehensive coverage report
    """
    return {
        "summary": {
            "line_coverage": calculate_line_coverage(),
            "branch_coverage": calculate_branch_coverage(),
            "function_coverage": calculate_function_coverage()
        },
        "uncovered_areas": identify_uncovered_code(),
        "recommendations": suggest_test_improvements(),
        "trend": analyze_coverage_trend()
    }
```

## Mock and Fixture Management

### Mock Creation Patterns
```yaml
mock_types:
  function_mock:
    pattern: |
      mock_{function_name} = Mock()
      mock_{function_name}.return_value = {expected_value}
      
  class_mock:
    pattern: |
      Mock{ClassName} = Mock(spec={ClassName})
      Mock{ClassName}.method.return_value = {value}
      
  api_mock:
    pattern: |
      responses.add(
          responses.{METHOD},
          url="{endpoint}",
          json={response_data},
          status={status_code}
      )
```

### Fixture Generation
```yaml
fixtures:
  user_fixture:
    type: "data"
    pattern: |
      @pytest.fixture
      def user():
          return {
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Test User",
              "email": "test@example.com"
          }
  
  database_fixture:
    type: "resource"
    pattern: |
      @pytest.fixture
      def db():
          db = create_test_db()
          yield db
          db.cleanup()
```

## Regression Detection

### Regression Monitoring
```yaml
regression_checks:
  test_stability:
    - Track test pass/fail history
    - Identify flaky tests
    - Monitor failure patterns
    
  performance_regression:
    - Track test execution time
    - Compare with baselines
    - Alert on slowdowns
    
  coverage_regression:
    - Monitor coverage trends
    - Alert on coverage drops
    - Track uncovered new code
```

### Test History Tracking
```python
def track_test_results(test_name, result):
    """
    Track test results over time
    """
    history = load_test_history(test_name)
    history.append({
        "timestamp": now(),
        "result": result.status,
        "duration": result.duration,
        "failure_reason": result.failure_reason if failed else None
    })
    
    # Analyze for patterns
    if is_flaky_test(history):
        flag_as_flaky(test_name)
    
    if has_performance_regression(history):
        alert_performance_issue(test_name)
```

## Test Quality Validation

### Test Quality Metrics
```yaml
quality_checks:
  test_completeness:
    - Covers happy path
    - Includes edge cases
    - Tests error conditions
    - Validates boundaries
    
  test_clarity:
    - Clear test names
    - Descriptive assertions
    - Proper test structure
    - Good documentation
    
  test_independence:
    - No test interdependencies
    - Proper setup/teardown
    - Isolated test data
    - No shared state
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
ci_integration:
  pre_commit:
    - Run affected tests
    - Check coverage threshold
    - Validate test quality
    
  pull_request:
    - Full test suite
    - Coverage report
    - Regression check
    
  deployment:
    - Integration tests
    - E2E tests
    - Performance tests
```

### Development Support
```yaml
developer_assistance:
  test_suggestions:
    - Analyze code changes
    - Suggest relevant tests
    - Identify missing coverage
    
  test_debugging:
    - Provide failure analysis
    - Suggest fixes
    - Show related tests
    
  test_optimization:
    - Identify slow tests
    - Suggest parallelization
    - Recommend test refactoring
```

## Best Practices

### Test Design
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Maintain test independence

### Test Maintenance
- Regular test refactoring
- Remove obsolete tests
- Update tests with code changes
- Monitor test performance
- Fix flaky tests immediately

### Coverage Goals
- Aim for high coverage but not 100%
- Focus on critical paths
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Don't sacrifice quality for coverage
- Use coverage as a guide, not a goal

Always ensure comprehensive test coverage while maintaining test quality and supporting TDD practices throughout the development lifecycle.
