## Embedded Git Standards & Conventions

### Branch Naming Conventions

You will enforce these branch naming patterns:

- **feature/[descriptive-name]** - New features and enhancements
- **fix/[issue-description]** - Bug fixes and issue resolutions
- **refactor/[component-name]** - Code refactoring and optimization
- **docs/[topic]** - Documentation updates
- **test/[test-area]** - Testing additions or modifications
- **chore/[task]** - Maintenance and housekeeping tasks
- **hotfix/[critical-issue]** - Urgent production fixes
- **release/[version]** - Release preparation branches

### Commit Message Standards

You will enforce Conventional Commits format:

**Format**: `type(scope): subject`

**Types**:

- **feat**: New feature or enhancement
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes
- **test**: Test additions or modifications
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes

**Rules**:

- Atomic commits - one logical change per commit
- Subject line max 50 characters, imperative mood
- Body (optional) wrapped at 72 characters
- Footer for breaking changes or issue references

**Examples**:

```bash
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(payment): resolve timeout issue in stripe integration
refactor(api): simplify error handling middleware
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(user): add integration tests for profile update
```

### Pull Request Standards

You will implement these PR requirements:

**Title Format**: `[Type] Brief description`

**PR Template Structure**:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes and motivation

## Changes
- Bullet points of specific changes
- File modifications
- New features or fixes

## Testing
- Test coverage details
- Manual testing performed
- Edge cases considered

## Related Issues

```

**PR Size Guidelines**:

- Ideal: <200 lines changed
- Acceptable: 200-400 lines
- Requires justification: >400 lines
- Split if: >600 lines

### Phase-Specific Git Actions

You will execute these actions at each development phase:

**Phase 1 - Design Start**:

- Create branch: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Initial commit: `feat(design): initialize [feature] design phase`
- Tag when complete: `design-complete-[feature]`

**Phase 2 - Tasks**:

- Commit task breakdowns: `docs(tasks): add task breakdown for [component]`
- Tag when ready: `tasks-ready-[feature]`

**Phase 3 - Implementation**:

- Atomic commits for each component
- Follow commit message standards strictly
- Regular pushes to remote for backup

**Quality & Review**:

- Commit test additions: `test([scope]): add tests for [functionality]`
- Commit fixes: `fix([scope]): resolve [issue] from review`
- Tag when ready: `ready-for-review-[feature]`

**Completion**:

- Create comprehensive PR following template
- Ensure all checks pass
- Coordinate review and approval
- Execute appropriate merge strategy

### Merge Strategies

You will select merge strategies based on context:

**Squash and Merge**:

- Use for: Feature branches with many commits
- Result: Single clean commit on main
- When: Feature is complete and tested

**Rebase and Merge**:

- Use for: Bug fixes with clean history
- Result: Linear history preservation
- When: Commits are already clean and atomic

**Create Merge Commit**:

- Use for: Release branches, major features
- Result: Preserve complete branch history

### Git Workflow Best Practices

You will enforce these practices:

**Daily Operations**:

- Pull from main before starting work
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Push to remote at least daily
- Keep branches up-to-date with main

**Code Review Process**:

- Self-review before requesting others
